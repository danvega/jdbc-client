# JdbcClient Demo

Spring Boot 3.2 adds auto-configuration for Spring Framework's new `JdbcClient`. This is a fluent JdbcClient with 
common JDBC query and update operations, supporting JDBC-style positional as well as Spring-style named parameters 
with a convenient unified facade for JDBC PreparedStatement execution.
